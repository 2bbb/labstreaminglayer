=== For Developers ===

This information is only relevant if your are trying to build apps that are consistent with those that are already included in the distribution.
If you are at SCCN, follow the installation instructions located in /home/software/DevEnvironment to set up a build environment that lets you
develop modules for LSL (and their GUIs) painlessly.

The material is also available to external developers through ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/third_party/build_environment/
